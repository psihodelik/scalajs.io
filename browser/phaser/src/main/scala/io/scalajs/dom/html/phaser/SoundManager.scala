/**
  * The Sound Manager is responsible for playing back audio via either the Legacy HTML Audio tag or via Web Audio if
  * the browser supports it. Note: On Firefox 25+ on Linux if you have media.gstreamer disabled in about:config then
  * it cannot play back mp3 or m4a files. The audio file type and the encoding of those files are extremely important.
  * Not all browsers can play all audio formats. There is a good guide to what's supported here: http://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/test/
  *
  * If you are reloading a Phaser Game on a page that never properly refreshes (such as in an AngularJS project) then
  * you will quickly run out of AudioContext nodes. If this is the case create a global var called PhaserGlobal on the
  * window object before creating the game. The active AudioContext will then be saved to window.PhaserGlobal.audioContext
  * when the Phaser game is destroyed, and re-used when it starts again.
  *
  * Mobile warning: There are some mobile devices (certain iPad 2 and iPad Mini revisions) that cannot play 48000 Hz audio.
  * When they try to play the audio becomes extremely distorted and buzzes, eventually crashing the sound system. The
  * solution is to use a lower encoding rate such as 44100 Hz. Sometimes the audio context will be created with a
  * sampleRate of 48000. If this happens and audio distorts you should re-create the context.
  * @param game the reference to the current game instance.
