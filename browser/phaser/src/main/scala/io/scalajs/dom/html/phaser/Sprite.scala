/**
  * Sprites are the lifeblood of your game, used for nearly everything visual.
  * At its most basic a Sprite consists of a set of coordinates and a texture that is rendered to the canvas.
  * They also contain additional properties allowing for physics motion (via Sprite.body), input handling (via Sprite.input),
  * events (via Sprite.events), animation (via Sprite.animations), camera culling and more. Please see the Examples for use cases.

    * Working in radians is slightly faster as it doesn't have to perform any calculations.
