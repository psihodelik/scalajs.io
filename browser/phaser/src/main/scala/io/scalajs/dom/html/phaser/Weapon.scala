/**
  * The Weapon Plugin provides the ability to easily create a bullet pool and manager.
  *
  * Weapons fire Phaser.Bullet objects, which are essentially Sprites with a few extra properties.
  * The Bullets are enabled for Arcade Physics. They do not currently work with P2 Physics.
  *
  * The Bullets are created inside of Weapon.bullets, which is a Phaser.Group instance. Anything you
  * can usually do with a Group, such as move it around the display list, iterate it, etc can be done
  * to the bullets Group too.
  *
  * Bullets can have textures and even animations. You can control the speed at which they are fired,
  * the firing rate, the firing angle, and even set things like gravity for them.
  *
  * A small example, assumed to be running from within a Phaser.State create method.
  * @param game   A reference to the current [[Phaser.Game]] instance.
  * @param parent The Phaser Plugin Manager which looks after this plugin.
  * @see http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Weapon.html
